# Currency-converter by Jaromir Kowerski

## Description

This is a web-based currency converter that allows users to quickly and easily convert PLN to EUR, USD, CHF, or CNY. The values of the different **currencies are hardcoded into the JavaScript code**, which means that they are fixed and **cannot be updated dynamically**.

The currency conversion tool was created as a homework project for a frontend developer course at **YouCode**, and features a simple user interface that makes it easy to use.
Overall, this currency converter is a simple but effective tool for anyone who needs to quickly convert PLN to one of several popular currencies.
